# PERSONAL WEBSITE
This is my personal site ! 

I would like it to highlight my portfolio projects along with some technical blog posts.

When the site is finished, it will be a basic single page application (SPA).

I built it using React, of course :)

Redux is being used for state management.

My Express server API has the basic CRUD capabilities.

I'm using Mongoose + MongoDB for object modeling and persistent data storage, respectively.
